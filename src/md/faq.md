**Q: Do I have to pay to use my Disklavier?**

**A: It depends.** You can use your Disklavier at no cost if you only wish to play back built-in songs and those you load in from a USB flash drive. However, if you wish to use Yamaha's DisklavierRadio or DisklavierTV services, you will be charged a fee of $19.99/month or $199.99/year. A free 3-month trial of these services is included with your Disklavier.

**Q: Is the Disklavier wireless?**

**A: No.** This is a common misconception about the Disklavier, because we generally hide all of the unsightly wiring. The Disklavier does need a network cable to connect to your home network, but we typically use wireless devices (usually the _eero_ mesh wifi system) to make the Disklavier seem wireless.

The difference on your end is minimal, but it does mean that we have to provide power to the mesh device that stays under your piano. We will also need to physically access your router in order to connect a partner mesh device. Note that this semi-wireless setup is optional. If you prefer, we can run a cable from your piano directly to your router or to the nearest network port. However, this setup is not recommended unless your piano is directly next to your router or a network port.

**Q: Can I record songs myself?**

**A: Yes.** You will be provided with a 32GB flash drive, which you can use to store your recordings and play them back any time you want.

**Q: Do I need a computer to use my Disklavier?**

**A: No.** Your Disklavier is controlled by your smartphone or tablet. However, if you prefer to use a computer either for controlling the playback or displaying the video for DisklavierTV, we can set that function up for you as well.

**Q: I'm not a tech person. Can I use the Disklavier?**

**A: Yes!** While the initial setup for Disklavier may seem intimidating, once our technicians get it up and running, using the Disklavier is simple. If you're unsure, we'll be happy to let you try the app in-store before making your purchase.
