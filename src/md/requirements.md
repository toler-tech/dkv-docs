**Review the items below with a customer who is purchasing a Disklavier. All items must be addressed in order to ensure that the installer brings the correct equipment to set up the Disklavier.**

1. The Disklavier must be connected to your home network. Is there a network port near where the piano will be placed, or will the piano be placed near your router? (If yes to either, skip to question 4.)

2. Do you already have a mesh wifi system in place in your home? (_eero_, LinkSys Velop, Orbi, Google WiFi/Home/Mesh, Luma, etc.)

   - **If yes:** We will need an additional adapter of the same kind in order to connect your Disklavier to the network. (Skip to question 4.)
   - **If no:** We will need to install an _eero_ system in your home. You can purchase the devices yourself, or we can purchase them and bill the amount to you.

3. How far will the piano be placed from your router? How many floors apart? You will generally need at least two _eero_ devices, plus one more for every 50 feet and for each floor.

4. Do you intend to use DisklavierTV? If so, you will need an AppleTV, Chromecast, or other screen mirroring device connected to the TV you wish to display your video on.

5. You will need one power outlet near the piano for your Disklavier. You will need another outlet if you are using a mesh wifi system to connect your Disklavier to your network. You will need an additional outlet if you intend to use DisklavierTV.

6. You will need a smartphone or tablet in order to control your Disklavier. This device can be your personal cell phone or tablet, or you may purchase a device specifically for use as your Disklavier controller.
